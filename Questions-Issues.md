# How to work with questions
In this course, we have some questions on lecture topics:
* Some questions are discussed during lecture (marked with green title)
* Some questions are intended for individual work (at the end of slides after conclusions, marked with orange title)

This repository can be used for discussion of these questions.

## Technical procedure

1. Teacher uploads lecture slides to Google Drive
1. One of the students creates new issues, one issue per question. Students should agree among themselves who will perform this duty for each lecture - it requires some work, but is also rewarded with extra points.
1. Students can answer the questions by posting comments to the issues
1. Also students can comment on the previous answers, e.g. agree or disagree (with explanations why), provide additional examples, different viewpoints, etc.
1. Teachers may also comment on student answers

## Languages

1. For this course, working languages are English, Ukrainian, Russian
1. The slides will be uploaded in all three languages
1. Students may post comments in one of these languages - please post in the language you are most comfortable with
1. If you don't understand one of these languages - you can use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) or similar tool to understand what your colleagues are saying

## How to format issues

1. Please create a new issue for each discussion slide (green title, name like "D01.1. Something") and a different new issue for each question slide (orange title, name like "Q01.1. Anything")
1. Additionally, please create another issue (one per lecture) for discussion of lecture slides, mistakes, typos, unclear points, etc.
1. Please use English only in the issue title (you can copy the title of the question from English version of slides)
1. In the issue description, please copy question titles in all three languages
1. For addional questions (orange slides with titles like Q01.1), please also copy slide contents in all three languages into the issue description. These slide contents usually provide additional explanations related to the question
1. For discussions during lectures (green slides with titles like D01.1), the slide contents are the answers discussed during lectures. For consistency, please post them as comments on the issue - not in issue description field! 
1. Typically for each question there will be 4 slides with such answers - 2 in Ukranian slides, 1 in English and 1 in Russian. Please post each of them as a separate comment. You don't need to post each answer as a separate comment.
1. Please mark these comments containing answers as discussions during lectures
1. In the issue about lecture slides, please use the English title of the lecture, and add "Slides discussion" at the end. E.g. "Lecture 1. Intro to algorithm theory. Slides discussion". In the issue description, please copy lecture title in all three languages
