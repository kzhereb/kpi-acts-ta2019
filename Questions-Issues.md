# How to work with questions
In this course, we have some questions on lecture topics:
* Some questions are discussed during lecture (marked with green title)
* Some questions are intended for individual work (at the end of slides after conclusions, marked with orange title)

This repository can be used for discussion of these questions.

## Technical procedure

1. Teacher uploads lecture slides to Google Drive
1. One of the students creates new issues, one issue per question. Students should agree among themselves who will perform this duty for each lecture - it requires some work, but is also rewarded with extra points.
1. Students can answer the questions by posting comments to the issues
1. Also students can comment on the previous answers, e.g. agree or disagree (with explanations why), provide additional examples, different viewpoints, etc.
1. Teachers may also comment on student answers

## Languages

1. For this course, working languages are English, Ukrainian, Russian
1. The slides will be uploaded in all three languages
1. Students may post comments in one of these languages - please post in the language you are most comfortable with
1. If you don't understand one of these languages - you can use [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) or similar tool to understand what your colleagues are saying

## How to format issues

1. Please create a new issue for each discussion slide (green title, name like "D01.1. Something") and a different new issue for each question slide (orange title, name like "Q01.1. Anything")
1. Additionally, please create another issue (one per lecture) for discussion of lecture slides, mistakes, typos, unclear points, etc. The title of this issue should be "Lecture <number>. <lecture-name>. Slides discussion" E.g. "Lecture 1. Intro to algorithm theory. Slides discussion"
1. Please use English only in the issue title (you can copy the title of the question from English version of slides)
1. In the issue description, please copy question titles in all three languages
1. For addional questions (orange slides with titles like Q01.1), please also copy slide contents in all three languages into the issue description. These slide contents usually provide additional explanations related to the question
1. For discussions during lectures (green slides with titles like D01.1), the slide contents are the answers discussed during lectures. For consistency, please post them as comments on the issue - not in issue description field! 
1. Typically for each question there will be 4 slides with such answers - 2 in Ukranian slides, 1 in English and 1 in Russian. Please post each of them as a separate comment. You don't need to post each answer as a separate comment. **Please add a notice that these answers were discussed during lectures, to distinguish them from later answers provided through GitHub** E.g. "Discussions during lecture: ..."
1. In the issue about lecture slides, please use the English title of the lecture, and add "Slides discussion" at the end. E.g. "Lecture 1. Intro to algorithm theory. Slides discussion". In the issue description, please copy lecture title in all three languages


## How to provide answers

1. Please add a comment on the issue that contains the question you are trying to answer
1. Please write your answer in the comment 
1. Try to provide enough details so that your answer is easy to understand.
1. Please try to provide your reasoning behind the answer - why do you think this is a correct answer, why it is relevant to this question. More detailed and easy to understand answers are worth more points.
1. Please provide references to resources (such as sites, books, video materials, ...) that support your answer. Adding multiple high quality references will improve your points significantly. 
1. On the other hand, please try to avoid providing low-quality references, duplicates, copy-pasted or plagiarised materials, etc.
1. You can also comment on the previous answers - both discussed during lectures, and submitted through GitHub. You can expand the previous answer, add more examples, or additional reasoning, or additional relevant references. You can also disagree with one of the previous comments - but in this case, please provide your reasoning, why do you think that such an answer was incorrect. 
1. Please try to avoid repeating the same answers that were already discussed during lectures or provided by other students. Repeating the same answer (either in the same words, or restating in other words but with the same essential content) is worth no points. If you answer looks similar to one of the previous answers, but you believe it is different - please provide some reasons why it is different.
